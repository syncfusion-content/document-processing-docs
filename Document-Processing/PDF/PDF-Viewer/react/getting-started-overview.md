# Getting started with Syncfusion React PDF Viewer


If you're starting to integrate the Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> React PDF Viewer into your application, choose the path below that matches how you'll run the viewer in your app (client-only or via a web service) and follow that tutorial.

- **Standalone** — Run the viewer entirely in the browser (no server rendering). This mode delivers excellent runtime performance and responsiveness because rendering and interaction happen on the client; it is ideal for quick prototyping and simple integrations.
- **Server‑backed** — Use a web service to perform PDF Viewer operations (rendering, document processing, or streaming). Choose this path when you need server-side processing for PDF Viewer operations.

This page is intentionally a short introduction — choose a path and follow its tutorial:
