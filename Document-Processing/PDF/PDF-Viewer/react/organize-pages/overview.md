# Organize pages in React PDF Viewer

The React PDF Viewer includes an Organize Pages panel for preparing documents before sharing. Use this panel to reorder pages, correct orientation, insert or remove pages, and duplicate content without leaving the viewer.

To open the Organize Pages panel, load a document and choose **Organize Pages** from the left vertical toolbar (when enabled).

The Organize Pages panel supports the following actions:

* **Rotate pages**: Fix page orientation in 90-degree increments to correct scanned pages.
* **Rearrange pages**: Drag and drop thumbnails to update the reading order.
* **Insert new pages**: Add blank pages at the required position.
* **Delete pages**: Remove pages that are no longer needed.
* **Copy pages**: Duplicate selected pages to reuse content elsewhere in the document.
* **Import a PDF document**: Merge the current document with pages from another PDF file.
* **Select all pages**: Apply bulk actions, such as rotation or deletion, to every page.
* **Save updates**: Review changes in real time and use **Save** or **Save As** to download the revised document.

After completing the changes, apply them by selecting **Save** to overwrite the current document or **Save As** to download a new copy that retains the updated page order.
