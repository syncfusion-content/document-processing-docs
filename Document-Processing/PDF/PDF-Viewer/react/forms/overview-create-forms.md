# Create, edit, style, and remove form fields in React PDF Viewer

The [React PDF Viewer](https://help.syncfusion.com/document-processing/pdf/pdf-viewer/react/overview) enables creation of interactive PDF form fields, modification of their behavior and appearance, and removal when no longer required. All form-field operations can be performed using either the [Form Designer user interface (UI)](https://document.syncfusion.com/demos/pdf-viewer/react/#/tailwind3/pdfviewer/form-designer) or the React APIs.

This section explains how to:

- [Create PDF form fields](./manage-form-fields/create-form-fields)
- [Edit form field behavior and values](./manage-form-fields/modify-form-fields)
- [Style the appearance of form fields](./manage-form-fields/customize-form-fields)
- [Remove form fields from a PDF document](./manage-form-fields/remove-form-fields)
