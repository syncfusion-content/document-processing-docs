# Create, Edit, Style, and Remove Form Fields in React PDF Viewer

The [React PDF Viewer](https://help.syncfusion.com/document-processing/pdf/pdf-viewer/react/overview) allows you to create interactive PDF form fields, update their behavior and appearance, and remove them when they are no longer needed.
All form field operations can be performed using either the [Form Designer user interface (UI)](https://document.syncfusion.com/demos/pdf-viewer/react/#/tailwind3/pdfviewer/form-designer) or [React APIs.](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/pdfviewer/overview)
