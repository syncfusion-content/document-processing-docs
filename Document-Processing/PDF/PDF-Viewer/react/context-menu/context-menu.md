# Context Menu in React PDF Viewer

The React PDF Viewer provides a built-in context menu for interacting with text, annotations, form fields, and document elements. It appears when right-clicking on different areas of the viewer, offering relevant actions based on the current selection.

The context menu supports several configurations:
* **Default Behavior**: Provides standard actions such as cut, copy, and annotation management.
* **Customization**: Menu options can be added, removed, or reordered to meet specific application requirements.
* **Disabling**: The menu can be fully disabled or replaced with custom logic.

Refer to the following sections for more details:

* [Built-in Context Menu](builtin-context-menu) – Describes default menu behavior and available items for different elements.
* [Customize Context Menu](custom-context-menu) – Details customization options, including adding custom items and dynamic updates.
