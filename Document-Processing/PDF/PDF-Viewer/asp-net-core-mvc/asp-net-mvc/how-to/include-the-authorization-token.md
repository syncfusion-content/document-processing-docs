# Include Authorization token

The PDF Viewer server library allows you to include the Authorization token in the PDF Viewer AJAX request using the ajaxRequest headers properties available in AjaxRequestSettings and it will be included in every AJAX request send from PDF Viewer.

The following steps are used to include the Authorization token for PDF viewer control,

**Step 1:** Follow the steps provided in the [link](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/aspnetmvc/documentation/pdfviewer/getting-started/) to create simple PDF Viewer sample.

**Step 2:** Add the following code snippet to include the authorization token,

```html

@Html.EJS().PdfViewer("pdfviewer").ServiceUrl(VirtualPathUtility.ToAbsolute("~/PdfViewer/")).DocumentPath("PDF_Succinctly.pdf").AjaxRequestSettings(new PdfViewerAjaxRequestSettings { WithCredentials = true, AjaxHeaders = new object[] { new { headerName = "Testingabc", headerValue = "Testing123" } } }).Render()

```
