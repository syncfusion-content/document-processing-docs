# Create, Edit, Style, and Remove Form Fields in ASP.NET Core PDF Viewer

The [ASP.NET Core PDF Viewer](https://help.syncfusion.com/document-processing/pdf/pdf-viewer/asp-net-core/overview) allows you to create interactive PDF form fields, update their behavior and appearance, and remove them when they are no longer needed.
All form field operations can be performed using either the [Form Designer user interface (UI)](https://document.syncfusion.com/demos/pdf-viewer/asp-net-core/pdfviewer/formdesigner#/tailwind3) or [ASP.NET Core APIs.](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/syncfusion.ej2.pdfviewer.pdfviewer.html)
