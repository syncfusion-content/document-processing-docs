# Create, Edit, Style, and Remove Form Fields in ASP.NET Core PDF Viewer

The [ASP.NET Core PDF Viewer](https://help.syncfusion.com/document-processing/pdf/pdf-viewer/asp-net-core/overview) enables creating interactive PDF form fields, updating their behavior and appearance, and removing them as needed. Form field operations can be performed using the [Form Designer UI](https://document.syncfusion.com/demos/pdf-viewer/asp-net-core/pdfviewer/formdesigner#/tailwind3) or [ASP.NET Core APIs](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/syncfusion.ej2.pdfviewer.pdfviewer.html).
