# Form Designer UI Interactions in Blazor PDF Viewer

The Form Designer in the Blazor PDF Viewer enables adding, editing, and manipulating form fields directly within a PDF document. It provides an intuitive interface to design interactive forms efficiently.

## Form Field Interactions

### Adding Form Fields

Click the **Edit Form Fields** icon on the toolbar, choose the required form field, and place it on the PDF document.

N> Form fields can also be added programmatically in SfPdfViewer for advanced scenarios.
[See Add form fields programmatically](./create-programmatically).

### Dragging Form Fields

Drag form fields to reposition them anywhere within the document. Click and hold a form field to move it to the desired location; alignment guides help ensure precise placement before releasing the field.

### Editing or Updating Form Fields

Edit form fields using the Form Field Properties panel. Open the panel by selecting the Properties option from the context menu that appears when right-clicking a form field.

The Form Field Properties panel consists of three tabs that provide customization options. Available options may vary by field type.

### Form Field Operations

Manage form fields using copy, cut, paste, undo, and redo operations. Duplicate fields with Copy (Ctrl+C), move them with Cut (Ctrl+X), and insert them elsewhere with Paste (Ctrl+V).

Revert the last change with Undo (Ctrl+Z) or restore an undone action with Redo (Ctrl+Y) to streamline workflow adjustments.
