# Hyperlink navigation in SfPdfViewer

Use hyperlinks in a PDF to navigate to external URLs or to destinations within the same document. Hyperlinks are extracted from the PDF and enabled by default.

- External links (HTTP/HTTPS, etc.) open in the browser according to browser settings (for example, in a new tab or window).
- In-document links navigate directly to the referenced page or location in the viewer.

If a document contains no hyperlinks, the viewer shows no link highlighting.
