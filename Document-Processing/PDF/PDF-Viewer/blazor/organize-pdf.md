# Organize pages in Blazor PDF Viewer

The SfPdfViewer component provides an Organize Pages panel that helps prepare documents before sharing. Use it to tidy scanned files, move pages into the correct order, and duplicate content without leaving the viewer.

To open the Organize Pages panel, load a document, ensure that the Organize Pages toolbar item is enabled, and choose **Organize Pages** from the left vertical toolbar. The document must allow page-level edits for the toolbar item to be available.

The Organize Pages panel supports the following actions:

* **Rotate pages**: Fix page orientation in 90-degree increments to correct scanned pages.
* **Rearrange pages**: Drag and drop page thumbnails to update the reading order.
* **Insert new pages**: Add blank pages at the required position.
* **Delete pages**: Remove pages that are no longer needed.
* **Duplicate pages**: Duplicate selected pages to reuse content elsewhere in the document.
* **Import a PDF document**: Merge the current document with pages from another PDF file.
* **Extract pages**: Extract pages from the current document as a separate PDF file.
* **Select all pages**: Apply bulk actions, such as rotation or deletion, to every page.
* **Save updates**: Review changes in real time and use **Save** or **Save As** to download the revised document.

After completing the changes, select **Save** to overwrite the current document or **Save As** to download a new copy that retains the updated page order.
