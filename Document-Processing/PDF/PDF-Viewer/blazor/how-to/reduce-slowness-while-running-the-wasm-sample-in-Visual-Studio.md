# Reduce slowness when running Blazor WebAssembly in Visual Studio

Performance issues may occur when running or debugging Blazor WebAssembly in Visual Studio. To improve execution speed, disable the .NET 9+ Mono WASM debugger, which can introduce overhead during debugging sessions.

Disabling the Mono WASM debugger can provide a smoother experience while running or debugging WebAssembly projects. This change affects debugging behavior; re-enable it when full debugging features are required.
