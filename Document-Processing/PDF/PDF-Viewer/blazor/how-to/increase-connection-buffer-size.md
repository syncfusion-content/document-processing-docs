# Increase the connection buffer size in Blazor SfPdfViewer Component

The Syncfusion&reg; Blazor SfPdfViewer supports increasing the SignalR connection buffer size by configuring MaximumReceiveMessageSize in `Program.cs`. This setting applies to Blazor Server and it does not apply to purely client-side WebAssembly apps.

```cshtml
builder.Services.AddSignalR(o => { o.MaximumReceiveMessageSize = 102400000; });
```
