# Document Loading Issues in Version 23.1 or Newer

If you're experiencing problems with your document not rendering in the viewer, especially when using version 23.1 or a newer version, follow these troubleshooting steps to resolve the issue:

* **Check for `viewer.dataBind()` Requirement**: Ensure that you have called `viewer.dataBind()` as required in version 23.1 or newer. This explicit call is Essential<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> for initializing data binding and document rendering correctly. It is must to call the dataBind() method before load.

```typescript
<button (click)="documentLoad()">Load</button>
<ejs-pdfviewer id="pdfViewer"
               style="height:640px;display:block">
</ejs-pdfviewer>

function documentLoad () {
    var pdfviewer = (<any>document.getElementById("pdfViewer")).ej2_instances[0];
    pdfViewer.serviceUrl = "https://document.syncfusion.com/web-services/pdf-viewer/api/pdfviewer";        pdfViewer.dataBind();
    pdfViewer.load("https://cdn.syncfusion.com/content/pdf/annotations.pdf",null);
    }
```

* **Verify Document Source**: Confirm that the document source or URL you're trying to display is valid and accessible. Incorrect URLs or document paths can lead to loading issues.

* **Network Connectivity**: Ensure that your application has a stable network connection. Document rendering may fail if the viewer can't fetch the document due to network issues.

* **Console Errors**: Use your browser's developer tools to check for any error messages or warnings in the console. These messages can provide insights into what's causing the document not to load.

* **Loading Sequence**: Make sure that you're calling `viewer.dataBind()` and initiating document loading in the correct sequence. The viewer should be properly initialized before attempting to load a document.

* **Update Viewer**: Ensure that you're using the latest version of the viewer library or framework. Sometimes, issues related to document loading are resolved in newer releases.

* **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**: If you're loading documents from a different domain, ensure that CORS headers are correctly configured to allow cross-origin requests.

* **Content Security Policies (CSP)**: Check if your application's Content Security Policy allows the loading of external resources, as this can affect document loading. Refer [here](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/javascript/documentation/common/troubleshoot/content-security-policy) to troubleshoot.

By following these troubleshooting steps, you should be able to address issues related to document loading in version 23.1 or newer, ensuring that your documents render correctly in the viewer.
