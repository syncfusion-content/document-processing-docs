# Managing Local Storage in Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> PDF Viewer

The Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> PDF Viewer provides the `enableLocalStorage` property, which allows you to control how session-specific data is stored. You can choose to store this data in an internal collection or rely on the default session storage.

### Using the enableLocalStorage Property

Set the `enableLocalStorage` property to manage whether the PDF Viewer uses session storage (default) or an internal collection. When set to `true`, session-specific data is kept in memory. Otherwise, session storage is used.

### Impact and Considerations

- **Increased Memory Usage**: Setting `enableLocalStorage` to `true` can increase memory usage, particularly with larger documents or those containing many interactive elements, such as form fields and annotations.
- **Avoiding Memory Leaks**: It is crucial to properly dispose of the PDF Viewer instance when it's no longer needed to prevent memory leaks, especially when using in-memory storage.
- **Default Behavior**: By default, this property is set to `false`, meaning the session storage mechanism is utilized unless explicitly changed.

### Enhanced Control

Leveraging the `enableLocalStorage` property provides greater flexibility in managing how data is stored during a session, allowing you to optimize performance and storage based on your applicationâ€™s specific requirements.
