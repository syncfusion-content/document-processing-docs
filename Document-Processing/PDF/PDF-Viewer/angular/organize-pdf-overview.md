# Organize pages in Angular PDF Viewer

The Angular PDF Viewer includes an Organize Pages panel for preparing documents before sharing. It enables reordering, rotating, inserting, deleting, and duplicating pages directly in the viewer so scanned or multi-page documents can be tidied without leaving the interface.

To open the Organize Pages panel, load a document that permits page-level edits, ensure the Organize Pages toolbar item is enabled, and choose **Organize Pages** from the left vertical toolbar. If the document does not allow page-level edits, the Organize Pages toolbar item is hidden.

The Organize Pages panel supports the following actions:

* **Rotate pages**: Rotate pages in 90-degree increments to correct orientation.
* **Rearrange pages**: Drag and drop thumbnails to change the reading order.
* **Insert new pages**: Add blank pages at a specified position.
* **Delete pages**: Remove pages that are no longer needed.
* **Copy pages**: Duplicate selected pages to reuse content elsewhere in the document.
* **Import a PDF document**: Merge pages from another PDF into the current document.
* **Select all pages**: Apply bulk operations (for example, rotate or delete) to every page.
* **Save updates**: Review changes in real time and use **Save** to overwrite the current document or **Save As** to download a new copy containing the updated page order.

After completing the changes, apply them by selecting **Save** to overwrite the current document or **Save As** to download a new copy that retains the updated page order.
