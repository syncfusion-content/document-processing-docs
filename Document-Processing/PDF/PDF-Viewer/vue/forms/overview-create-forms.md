# Create, Edit, Style, and Remove Form Fields in Vue PDF Viewer

The [Vue PDF Viewer](https://help.syncfusion.com/document-processing/pdf/pdf-viewer/vue/overview) allows you to create interactive PDF form fields, update their behavior and appearance, and remove them when they are no longer needed.
All form field operations can be performed using either the [Form Designer user interface (UI)](https://document.syncfusion.com/demos/pdf-viewer/vue/#/tailwind3/pdfviewer/form-designer.html) or [Vue APIs.](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/pdfviewer/overview)

This section explains how to:

- [Create PDF form fields](./manage-form-fields/create-form-fields)
- [Edit form field behavior and values](./manage-form-fields/modify-form-fields)
- [Style the appearance of form fields](./manage-form-fields/customize-form-fields)
- [Remove form fields from a PDF document](./manage-form-fields/remove-form-fields)
