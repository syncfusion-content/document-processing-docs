# Organize Pages in Mobile PDF Viewer vue

The PDF Viewer offers a mobile-responsive layout for the `Organize Pages` feature, ensuring a seamless experience on smaller devices. On mobile devices, the toolbar and navigation elements adapt to screen size to provide easy access to page management tools.

## Mobile-Friendly Toolbar

In the mobile view, the Organize Pages toolbar is displayed at the bottom of the screen for easy one-handed access. The toolbar includes the same set of tools as the desktop version, such as insert, delete, and rotate, but with a mobile-optimized layout.

## Context Menu for Page Operations

To perform actions on a page thumbnail, tap and hold the thumbnail to open a context menu. This menu contains the available page operations:

- Rotate Clockwise: Rotate the selected page 90 degrees clockwise.
- Rotate Counter-Clockwise: Rotate the selected page 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
- Insert Page: Insert a new page.
- Copy Page: Duplicate the selected page.
- Delete Page: Remove the selected page.
- Select All: Select all pages in the document.

## Rearranging Pages on Mobile

To rearrange pages, tap and hold a page thumbnail to select it, then drag it to the desired position. A visual indicator shows the drop location.

The mobile interface enables efficient PDF page management on handheld devices.
