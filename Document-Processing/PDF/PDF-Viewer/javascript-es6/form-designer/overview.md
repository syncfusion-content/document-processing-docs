# Forms overview

Syncfusion TypeScript PDF Viewer provides a complete forms experience. Design new forms or enhance existing PDFs, fill and validate fields, import or export data, and capture signatures — all via an intuitive UI and rich APIs.

## Form Designer

Create and customize interactive fields directly on the PDF page.
- Add fields: textbox, checkbox, radio button, dropdown, list box, signature, and initials
- Edit quickly: move, resize, align, distribute, copy/paste, undo/redo
- Configure properties: name, value, font, color, border, alignment, required/read-only/visibility, tab order
- Manage fields: select, group/ungroup, reorder, or delete
- Save and print: persist designed fields in the PDF and print with appearances
- Tailor the UI: show/hide or customize the Form Designer toolbar, and handle events for add/edit/select/move/resize

## Form Fields

Work with the runtime form fields present in a PDF (AcroForm).
- Parse and render existing fields
- Fill fields and validate input (required, read-only, print visibility)
- Import/Export form data as JSON, XFDF, FDF, or as a plain object
- Control interaction: toggle read-only, show/hide, and manage printing behavior

## Supported form field types

- Textbox
- Password
- CheckBox
- RadioButton
- ListBox
- DropDown
- Signature field
- Initial field

## Typical workflows

- Design → Save → Fill: create or modify fields, save them into the PDF, then fill and validate
- Fill → Export/Import: complete forms and export data to JSON/XFDF/FDF, or import data to prefill
- Customize → Integrate: wire up events and business rules; tailor the designer toolbar for your app
