**Prerequisites**:

* Install .NET SDK: Ensure that you have the .NET SDK installed on your system. You can download it from the [.NET Downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download).
* Install Visual Studio Code: Download and install Visual Studio Code from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
* Install C# Extension for VS Code: Open Visual Studio Code, go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X), and search for 'C#'. Install the official [C# extension provided by Microsoft](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp).



Step 1: Open the terminal (Ctrl+` ) and run the following command to create a .NET Core console application.

```
dotnet new console -n CreatePdfMacOSApp
```
Step 2: Replace ****CreatePdfMacOSApp** with your desired project name.

Step 3: Navigate to the project directory using the following command

```
cd CreatePdfMacOSApp
```
Step 4: Use the following command in the terminal to add the [Syncfusion.Pdf.Net.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Syncfusion.pdf.Net.Core) package to your project.

```
dotnet add package Syncfusion.Pdf.Net.Core
```
N> Starting with v16.2.0.x, if you reference Syncfusion<sup>&reg;</sup> assemblies from the trial setup or from the NuGet feed, you also have to add "Syncfusion.Licensing" assembly reference and include a license key in your projects. Please refer to this [link](https://help.syncfusion.com/common/essential-studio/licensing/overview) to know about registering Syncfusion<sup>&reg;</sup> license key in your application to use our components.

Step 5: Include the following Namespaces in the Program.cs file.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="C#" %}

using Syncfusion.Pdf;
using Syncfusion.Pdf.Graphics;
using Syncfusion.Drawing;
using System.IO;

{% endhighlight %}

{% endtabs %}

Step 6: Add the following code sample to the *Program.cs* file to **create PDF document in .NET Core application on Mac OS**.

{% tabs %}

{% highlight c# tabtitle="C#" %}

//Create a new PDF document.
PdfDocument document = new PdfDocument();
// Set the page size.
document.PageSettings.Size = PdfPageSize.A4;
//Add a page to the document.
PdfPage page = document.Pages.Add();

//Create PDF graphics for the page.
PdfGraphics graphics = page.Graphics;
//Load the image from the disk.
FileStream imageStream = new FileStream("AdventureCycle.jpg", FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read);
PdfBitmap image = new PdfBitmap(imageStream);
//Draw an image.
graphics.DrawImage(image, new RectangleF(130,0, 250, 100));

//Draw header text. 
graphics.DrawString("Adventure Works Cycles", new PdfStandardFont(PdfFontFamily.TimesRoman, 20, PdfFontStyle.Bold), PdfBrushes.Gray, new PointF(150, 150));

//Add paragraph. 
string text = "Adventure Works Cycles, the fictitious company on which the AdventureWorks sample databases are based, is a large, multinational manufacturing company. The company manufactures and sells metal and composite bicycles to North American, European and Asian commercial markets. While its base operation is located in Washington with 290 employees, several regional sales teams are located throughout their market base.";
//Create a text element with the text and font.
PdfTextElement textElement = new PdfTextElement(text, new PdfStandardFont(PdfFontFamily.TimesRoman, 12));
//Draw the text in the first column.
textElement.Draw(page, new RectangleF(0, 200, page.GetClientSize().Width, page.GetClientSize().Height));

//Create a PdfGrid.
PdfGrid pdfGrid = new PdfGrid();
//Add values to the list.
List<object> data = new List<object>();
Object row1 = new { Product_ID = "1001", Product_Name = "Bicycle", Price = "10,000" };
Object row2 = new { Product_ID = "1002", Product_Name = "Head Light", Price = "3,000" };
Object row3 = new { Product_ID = "1003", Product_Name = "Break wire", Price = "1,500" };
data.Add(row1);
data.Add(row2);
data.Add(row3);
//Add list to IEnumerable.
IEnumerable<object> dataTable = data;
//Assign data source.
pdfGrid.DataSource = dataTable;
//Apply built-in table style.
pdfGrid.ApplyBuiltinStyle(PdfGridBuiltinStyle.GridTable4Accent3);
//Draw the grid to the page of PDF document.
pdfGrid.Draw(graphics, new RectangleF(0, 300, page.Size.Width - 80, 0));

//Create file stream.
using (FileStream outputFileStream = new FileStream(Path.GetFullPath(@"Output.pdf"), FileMode.Create, FileAccess.ReadWrite))
{
    //Save the PDF document to file stream.
    document.Save(outputFileStream);
}

{% endhighlight %}

{% endtabs %}

Step 7: Build the project.

Run the following command in terminal to build the project.

   ```
   dotnet build
   ```

Step 8: Run the project.

Run the following command in terminal to build the project.

   ```
   dotnet run
```
