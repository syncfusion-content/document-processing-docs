# Why aren't *.otf fonts embedded in Microsoft Office documents?

Microsoft Office doesn’t support embedding *.otf (OpenType) fonts. It only supports *.ttf (TrueType) fonts.

To embed fonts in Office documents, use *.ttf fonts instead. Replace *.otf fonts with *.ttf alternatives to ensure consistent formatting when sharing your document. For more details, see the [official Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/troubleshoot/office-suite-issues/fails-embedding-adobe-opentype-font).
