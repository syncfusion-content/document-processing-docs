{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}  

Step 6: Add a new button in the **Index.cshtml** as shown below.

{% tabs %}  
{% highlight CSHTML %}
@{
    Html.BeginForm("LoadingandSaving", "Home", FormMethod.Get);
    {
        <div>
            <br>
            <input type="submit" value="Loading and Saving Document" style="width:230px;height:27px" />
        </div>
    }
    Html.EndForm();
}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

Step 7: Include the below code snippet in **HomeController.cs** to **load and save an Excel file and download it**.

{% tabs %}  
{% highlight c# tabtitle="C#" %}
//Create an instance of ExcelEngine
using (ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine())
{
    IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;
    application.DefaultVersion = ExcelVersion.Xlsx;

    //Load an existing Excel document
    FileStream inputStream = new FileStream("Data/InputTemplate.xlsx", FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read);
    IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Open(inputStream);

    //Access first worksheet from the workbook.
    IWorksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

    //Set Text in cell A3.
    worksheet.Range["A3"].Text = "Hello World";

    //Save the Excel to MemoryStream 
    MemoryStream outputStream = new MemoryStream();
    workbook.SaveAs(outputStream);

    //Set the position
    outputStream.Position = 0;

    //Download the Excel document in the browser.
    return File(outputStream, "application/msexcel", "Output.xlsx");
}
{% endhighlight %}
