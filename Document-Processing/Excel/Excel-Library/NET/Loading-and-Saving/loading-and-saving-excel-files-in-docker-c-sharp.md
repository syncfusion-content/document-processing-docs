# Loading and Saving Excel files in Docker

[Syncfusion Excel library for ASP.NET Core platform](https://www.syncfusion.com/document-processing/excel-framework/net-core/excel-library) can be used to create, read, edit Excel files in Azure App Service on Windows.

## Steps to Load and Save an Excel document in Docker

The below steps illustrates loading and saving a simple Invoice formatted Excel document in Docker.

Step 4: Install the [Syncfusion.XlsIO.Net.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Syncfusion.XlsIO.Net.Core) NuGet package as reference to your .NET Standard applications from [NuGet.org](https://www.nuget.org).

N> Starting with v16.2.0.x, if you reference Syncfusion assemblies from trial setup or from the NuGet feed, you also have to add "Syncfusion.Licensing" assembly reference and include a license key in your projects. Please refer to this [link](https://help.syncfusion.com/common/essential-studio/licensing/overview) to know about registering Syncfusion license key in your applications to use our components. 

Step 5: Include the following namespaces in **Program.cs**.

{% tabs %}  
{% highlight c# tabtitle="C#" %}
using Syncfusion.XlsIO;
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}  

Step 6: Include the below code snippet in **Program.cs** to **load and save an Excel file in docker**.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="C#" %}
using (ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine())
{
    IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;
    application.DefaultVersion = ExcelVersion.Xlsx;

    //Load an existing Excel document.
    FileStream inputStream = new FileStream(Path.GetFullPath(@"Data/InputTemplate.xlsx"), FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read);
    IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Open(inputStream);

    //Access first worksheet from the workbook.
    IWorksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

    //Set Text in cell A3.
    worksheet.Range["A3"].Text = "Hello World";

    //Saving the workbook.
    FileStream outputStream = new FileStream(Path.GetFullPath("Output/Output.xlsx"), FileMode.Create, FileAccess.Write);
    workbook.SaveAs(outputStream);

    //Dispose streams.
    inputStream.Dispose();
    outputStream.Dispose();
}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %} 

Step 7: Add Docker support to that application by clicking <b>Add -> Docker Support.</b>

Step 9: Open the **Dockerfile** to see the default Docker commands that are shown below.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight Dockerfile %}
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runtime:8.0 AS base
USER $APP_UID
WORKDIR /app

FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:8.0 AS build
ARG BUILD_CONFIGURATION=Release
WORKDIR /src
COPY ["Loading and Saving/Loading and Saving.csproj", "Loading and Saving/"]
RUN dotnet restore "./Loading and Saving/Loading and Saving.csproj"
COPY . .
WORKDIR "/src/Loading and Saving"
RUN dotnet build "./Loading and Saving.csproj" -c $BUILD_CONFIGURATION -o /app/build

FROM build AS publish
ARG BUILD_CONFIGURATION=Release
RUN dotnet publish "./Loading and Saving.csproj" -c $BUILD_CONFIGURATION -o /app/publish /p:UseAppHost=false

FROM base AS final
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=publish /app/publish .
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "Loading and Saving.dll"]
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

Step 10: Select Docker option and Run the application.
