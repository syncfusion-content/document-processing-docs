# How to use AND and OR operators in the filter?

You can use AND and OR operators in the filter by using XlsIO. The following code snippet illustrates this.

{% tabs %}  
{% highlight c# tabtitle="C# [Cross-platform]" %}
using (ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine())
{
	IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;
	application.DefaultVersion = ExcelVersion.Xlsx;
	FileStream inputStream = new FileStream(Path.GetFullPath(@"Data/InputTemplate.xlsx"), FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read);
	IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Open(inputStream);
	IWorksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

	#region Filter
	//Creating an AutoFilter in the first worksheet. Specifying the AutoFilter range
	worksheet.AutoFilters.FilterRange = worksheet.Range["A1:A10"];

	//Column index to which AutoFilter must be applied
	IAutoFilter filter = worksheet.AutoFilters[0];
  // This property determines how multiple filter conditions are combined.
  // If set to false, the filter will use the OR operator, meaning any condition can be met.
  // If set to true, the filter will use the AND operator, meaning all conditions must be met.
  // By default, this property is set to true (AND operator).
  filter.IsAnd = false;
	//To apply Top10Number filter, IsTop and IsTop10 must be enabled
	filter.IsTop = true;
	filter.IsTop10 = true;

	//Setting Top10 filter with number of cell to be filtered from top
	filter.Top10Number = 5;
	#endregion

	#region Save
	//Saving the workbook
	FileStream outputStream = new FileStream(Path.GetFullPath("Output/Filter.xlsx"), FileMode.Create, FileAccess.Write);
	workbook.SaveAs(outputStream);
	#endregion

	//Dispose streams
	outputStream.Dispose();
	inputStream.Dispose();
}
