# Can the page count of the PDF document be determined before the Excel to PDF conversion?

No. XlsIO does not support determining the page count of the PDF document before Excel to PDF conversion. The final page count depends on factors such as print settings, page layout, scaling options, and content distribution. These elements can only be assessed during the conversion process, so calculating the page count in advance is not possible.
