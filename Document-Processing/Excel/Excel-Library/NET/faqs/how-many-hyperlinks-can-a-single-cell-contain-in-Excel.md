# How many hyperlinks can a single cell contain in Excel?

In Microsoft Excel, a single cell can contain only **one hyperlink**. It is not possible to assign multiple hyperlinks to the same cell. This limitation applies when working with Excel manually or programmatically using the Syncfusion .NET Excel library (XlsIO).
