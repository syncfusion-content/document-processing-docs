# XlsIO support for determining Excel page count before PDF conversion

XlsIO does not support determining the total number of pages in an Excel file before converting it to PDF. The final page count depends on factors such as print settings, page layout, scaling options, and content distribution. These elements can only be assessed during the conversion process, so calculating the page count in advance is not possible.
