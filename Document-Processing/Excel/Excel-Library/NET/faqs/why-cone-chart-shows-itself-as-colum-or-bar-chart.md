# Why cone chart shows itself as column or bar chart?

It is not possible to create a cone chart directly in MS-Excel. A 3D type column or bar chart should be created and the respective column or bar shape should be transformed  to a cone.  

So the cone chart always shows it self as a column or bar type chart.
