# Does XlsIO support changing the colors of built-in icon sets?

No. In Microsoft Excel, the colors of built-in icon sets used in conditional formatting (such as arrows, traffic lights, and symbols) are fixed and cannot be customized. XlsIO follows the same behavior and does not provide support for changing these icon colors programmatically. You can apply icon sets and configure their thresholds through conditional formatting, but the icon colors remain predefined by Excel.
