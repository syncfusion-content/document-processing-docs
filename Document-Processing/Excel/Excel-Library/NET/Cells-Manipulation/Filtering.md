# Filtering Data in Excel Document

Using [AutoFilters](https://support.office.com/en-US/article/Filter-data-in-a-range-or-table-01832226-31b5-4568-8806-38c37dcc180e), data can be filtered to enable quick and easy way to find and work with a subset of data in a range of cells. When the data is filtered, entire rows are hidden if values in one or more columns does not meet the filtering criteria. The following are the types of filters that can be used in XlsIO.

* Custom Filter (Conditional)
* Combination Filter (Text and DateTime filter)
* Dynamic Filter
* Color Filter
* Icon Filter
* Advanced Filter

## Applying Filter

The following code example illustrates how to apply simple auto filters.

## Color Filter

Color Filter can be used to filter data based on the color applied to the cell or the color applied to the text in the cell. 

The following code example illustrates how to apply color filter based on cell color (fill color applied to the cell).

{% tabs %}

To filter cells based on font color of the text inside cells just change the [ExcelColorFilterType](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/document-processing/Syncfusion.XlsIO.ExcelColorFilterType.html) to Font Color. 

The following code example illustrates how to filter the cells based on font color.

## Icon Filter

Icon filter can be used to filter data that has conditional formatting with Icon Sets applied. Applying Icon Sets for numeric data adds icons to each cell based on the value present in that cell. Using Icon Filter, the data that has only a specific Icon in it can be filtered easily.

The following code example illustrates how to apply icon filter.

## Advanced Filter

Advanced Filter can be used to perform more complex filtering other than basic filters. Data can be filtered with custom defined criteria range.

Advanced Filter support two types of filter action.

1. Filter in Place
2. Filter Copy

**Filter in Place**: Filter data in same location.
**Filter Copy**: Filter and copy data into new location within a worksheet.

Advanced Filter also provides an option to filter the unique records. This will remove the duplicate record from filtered data.

The following code example illustrates how to apply Advanced Filter in worksheet.

A complete working example to apply advanced filter on Excel data in C# is present on [this GitHub page](https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/XlsIO-Examples/tree/master/Editing%20Excel%20cells/Advanced%20Filter/.NET/Advanced%20Filter).

## Accessing Filter

A filter and its criteria can be accessed based on its column index. 

The following code example illustrates how to access different types of filters.
