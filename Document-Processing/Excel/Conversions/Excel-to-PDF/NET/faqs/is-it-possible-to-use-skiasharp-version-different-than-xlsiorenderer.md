# Is it possible to use skiasharp version different than XlsIORenderer?

No. When using skiasharp version lower or higher than the XlsIORenderer dependent version, possible API conflict will occur. Due to this, a run time error can occur. 

So, it is not suggested to other versions of Skiasharp along with XlsIORenderer apart from the mentioned version.
