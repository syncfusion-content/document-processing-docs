# Template in React Spreadsheet component

Cell Template is used for adding HTML elements into Spreadsheet. You can add the cell template in spreadsheet by using the `template` property and specify the address using the `address` property inside the `ranges` property. You can customize the Html elements similar to Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> components (TextBox, DropDownList, RadioButton, MultiSelect, DatePicker etc) by using the `beforeCellRender` event. In this demo, Cell template is applied to `C2:C9` and instantiated with Html input components like TextBox, RadioButton, TextArea. You need to bind the events to perform any operations through HTML elements or Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> components. Here, we have added `change` event in to the MultiSelect control, and we have updated the selected data into the spreadsheet cell through that change event.

The following sample describes the above behavior.
