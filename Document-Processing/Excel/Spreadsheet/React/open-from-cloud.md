# Open Excel Files from Cloud Storage in React Spreadsheet Component

In the Syncfusion React Spreadsheet, users can load Excel files directly from cloud storage services. The Spreadsheet integrates with your server-side application to retrieve files stored in different cloud providers. Once the file is fetched, it is processed on the server and returned to the client as a Spreadsheet JSON model, allowing the workbook to be displayed seamlessly in the Spreadsheet component.
