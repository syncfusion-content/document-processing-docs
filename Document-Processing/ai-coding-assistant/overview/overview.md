# Syncfusion <sup>&reg;</sup> AI Coding Assistant Overview


## Overview  

The **Syncfusion<sup>&reg;</sup> AI Coding Assistant** are designed to streamline your development workflow when building .NET applications with Syncfusion<sup>&reg;</sup> components. It uses contextual knowledge of the Syncfusion<sup>&reg;</sup> component library to generate accurate code snippets, configuration examples, and guided explanations—minimizing documentation searches and maximizing productivity. 


AI Coding Assistant:

  * **The SyncfusionDocumentSDKAssistant MCP Server** is designed to process advanced prompts and return intelligent, context-aware        code suggestions through   [MCP-compatible clients](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients). It specifically enhances productivity when working with **Syncfusion<sup>&reg;</sup> Document Processing libraries**, including **[PDF](https://help.syncfusion.com/document-processing/pdf/overview), [Word](https://help.syncfusion.com/document-processing/word/overview) (DocIO), [Excel](https://help.syncfusion.com/document-processing/excel/overview) (XlsIO), and [PowerPoint](https://help.syncfusion.com/document-processing/powerpoint/overview)**. 


## Getting Started

To use the AI Coding Assistant, you need:

  *	A [Syncfusion<sup>&reg;</sup> user account](https://www.syncfusion.com/account)
  *	An active Syncfusion<sup>&reg;</sup> license (any of the following):
     * [Commercial License](https://www.syncfusion.com/sales/unlimitedlicense)
     * [Free Community License](https://www.syncfusion.com/products/communitylicense)

  *	An active [API KEY](https://syncfusion.com/account/api-key)
  *	Any .NET application that includes Syncfusion Document Processing libraries

## Unlimited Access

Syncfusion<sup>&reg;</sup> offers unlimited access to the AI Coding Assistant, with no limitations on:

  * Number of requests
  *	Components usage
  *	Query types
  *	Usage duration
  
This ensures users can fully leverage Syncfusion<sup>&reg;</sup> components to enhance their development experience without limitations.

## Best Practices

  *	Initial Setup: Use the tools to quickly add and configure Syncfusion® components in your .NET applications.
  *	Feature Tuning: Enable or disable component features through prompt-based configuration for tailored functionality.
  *	Data Binding: Generate sample data for testing and prototyping. Avoid using sensitive or production data to ensure security.
  *	Step-by-step explanations: Use annotated code to understand component behavior. Note that the level of detail may vary depending on   
  the tool, mode, and AI model used. Refer to the [Syncfusion<sup>&reg;</sup> Document SDK Documentation](https://help.syncfusion.com/document-processing/introduction) for in-depth information.
  * Troubleshooting: Resolve common issues with AI-generated suggestions. For complex problems, refer to [documentation](https://help.syncfusion.com/document-processing/introduction) or [support](https://support.syncfusion.com/support/tickets/create).
  
  >Always check AI-generated content and code for accuracy before using it.

## Recommendations

  * Session Management: Start new sessions when switching tasks to ensure prompt relevance and maintain content focus.
  * Model Compatibility: For optimal performance, use the tools with advanced AI models such as GPT-5 or Claude Sonnet 4.

## Privacy & Data Handling

The Syncfusion<sup>&reg;</sup> AI Coding Assistant is designed with privacy in mind:

  *	The tools do not access your project files or workspace directly.
  *	User prompts are not stored by any of the tools or used for any other purpose.
  *	Prompts are not used to train Syncfusion<sup>&reg;</sup> models.
  *	The assistant generates context, while the final output is handled by your selected AI model.
