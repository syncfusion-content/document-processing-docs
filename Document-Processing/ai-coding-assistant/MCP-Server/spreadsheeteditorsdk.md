- Troubleshooting assistance for common integration challenges.

## Prerequisites

Before using <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@syncfusion/spreadsheeteditorsdk-assistant">SyncfusionSpreadsheetEditorSDKAssistant</a>, ensure you have:

* Required [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) version >= 18
* A [compatible MCP client](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients) (VS Code with GitHub Copilot, [Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> CodeStudio](https://www.syncfusion.com/code-studio/), etc.)
* An active Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> license (any of the following):
  - [Commercial License](https://www.syncfusion.com/sales/unlimitedlicense)
  - [Free Community License](https://www.syncfusion.com/products/communitylicense)
  - [Free Trial](https://www.syncfusion.com/account/manage-trials/start-trials)
* An active [API KEY](https://syncfusion.com/account/api-key)

## Unlimited Access

Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> offers unlimited access to this MCP server. There are no restrictions on:

* Number of requests
* Components usage
* Query types
* Usage duration

This ensures users can fully leverage Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> components to enhance their development experience without limitations.

## Installation and setup

Before you can invoke the ```SyncfusionSpreadsheetEditorSDKAssistant``` MCP server, you need to configure your MCP client with these core settings. The **Generic MCP Server Settings** shown below are identical across all clients:

### Generic MCP Server Settings

- **npm package name**: ```@syncfusion/spreadsheeteditorsdk-assistant```
- **Type**: stdio (standard input/output transport)
- **Command**: npx
- **Arguments**: -y
- **Server name**: syncfusionSpreadsheetEditorSDKAssistant

#### API Key Configuration		

Login to your [Syncfusion account](http://syncfusion.com/account/) and generate an API Key from the [API Key page](https://www.syncfusion.com/account/api-key). Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_FILE_PATH` or `YOUR_API_KEY` in the configuration files with your generated key.
    
There are two options:
    
* **Using an API Key File (Recommended)**

  Store your API key in a separate file and reference its path in the `Syncfusion_API_Key_Path` environment parameter. This approach is more secure as you don't expose the key directly in configuration files.

  **Supported file formats:** `.txt` or `.key` file

~~~json
   "env": {
     "Syncfusion_API_Key_Path": "YOUR_API_KEY_FILE_PATH" // "D:\\syncfusion-key.txt" (or) "D:\\syncfusion-key.key"
    }
~~~
* **Direct API Key**

  Paste your `Syncfusion_API_Key` directly in the configuration file's environment parameter.

~~~json
   "env": {
     "Syncfusion_API_Key": "YOUR_API_KEY"
  }
~~~

[SyncfusionSpreadsheetEditorSDKAssistant](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@syncfusion/spreadsheeteditorsdk-assistant) can be configured in various MCP clients. Below are setup instructions for popular environment:

### Syncfusion<sup>&reg;</sup> Code Studio

  *	In [Code Studio](https://www.syncfusion.com/code-studio/), open MCP Marketplace and navigate to the ```Custom Servers``` tab.
  *	Enter the Server Name as ```spreadsheeteditorsdk-mcp```, choose Server Type as npm package, and set the NPM Package name to ```@syncfusion/spreadsheeteditorsdk-assistant```.
  *	Add an environment variable as ```Syncfusion_API_Key``` and value as your [Syncfusion API key](https://syncfusion.com/account/api-key), then click **Install Server**.
  *	Once installed, the server will appear in the User Installed Server list and will be added to the **config.yaml** file.
  *	The server is now ready for use in Code Studio. For more details, refer to the Code Studio [documentation](https://help.syncfusion.com/code-studio/reference/configure-properties/mcp/customservers).

For additional details, see the Code Studio [documentation](https://help.syncfusion.com/code-studio/reference/configure-properties/mcp/customservers).

### VS Code (GitHub Copilot MCP)

* To configure an MCP server for a specific workspace, you can create a `.vscode/mcp.json` file in your workspace folder.

  ```json
  {
    "servers": {
      "syncfusion-spreadsheeteditorsdk-assistant": {
        "type": "stdio",
        "command": "npx",
        "args": [
          "-y",
          "@syncfusion/spreadsheeteditorsdk-assistant@latest"
        ],
        "env": {
        "Syncfusion_API_Key_Path": "YOUR_API_KEY_FILE_PATH",
          // or
        "Syncfusion_API_Key": "YOUR_API_KEY"
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

* After updating the configuration in mcp.json, you’ll notice a “Start” option at the top of the config. This allows you to easily start the <a href ="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@syncfusion/spreadsheeteditorsdk-assistant">SyncfusionSpreadsheetEditorSDKAssistant</a> server directly from the settings interface without additional commands.

* Confirm that [SyncfusionSpreadsheetEditorSDKAssistant](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@syncfusion/spreadsheeteditorsdk-assistant) is being used (this does not happen automatically). Look for a statement in the output, which is similar to:
    * ```SyncfusionSpreadsheetEditorSDKAssistant is running...``` (in VS Code)

* For more details, refer to the official <a href = "https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/mcp-servers?view=vs-2022"> Visual Studio documentation</a>.

### Cursor

To configure an MCP server for a specific workspace, you can create a .cursor/mcp.json file in your workspace folder.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "syncfusion-spreadsheeteditorsdk-assistant": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@syncfusion/spreadsheeteditorsdk-assistant@latest"
      ],
      "env": {
      "Syncfusion_API_Key_Path": "YOUR_API_KEY_FILE_PATH",
      // or
      "Syncfusion_API_Key": "YOUR_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
For more details, refer to the <a href = "https://docs.cursor.com/en/context/mcp#using-mcp-json">Cursor documentation</a>.

### JetBrains IDEs

* Go to Settings -> Tools -> AI Assistant -> Model Context Protocol (MCP).
