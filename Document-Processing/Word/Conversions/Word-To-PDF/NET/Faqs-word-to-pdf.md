# Frequently Asked Questions

The frequently asked questions about Word to PDF conversion in Essential DocIO are listed below.

## Is it possible to specify PDF conformance level in Word to PDF conversion?

Yes, you can specify the PDF conformance level in Word to PDF conversion. For more details, refer [PDF Conformance](/document-processing/pdf/pdf-library/net/working-with-pdf-conformance)

## How to perform Word to PDF in Linux prior to v18.4 release?

In Linux OS, you can perform the Word to PDF conversion using .NET Core (Targeting .netcoreapp) application. You can refer [Word to PDF conversion NuGet packages](https://help.syncfusion.com/document-processing/word/word-library/net/nuget-packages-required#converting-word-document-to-pdf) to know about the packages required to deploy .NET Core (Targeting .netcoreapp) application with Word to PDF conversion capabilities.

In addition to the previous NuGet packages, SkiaSharp.Linux helper NuGet package is required that can be generated by the following steps: 

1. Download libSkiaSharp.so [here](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/releases/download/v1.59.3/libSkiaSharp.so).
2. Create a folder and name it as SkiaSharp.Linux and place the downloaded file in the folder structure "SkiaSharp.Linux\runtimes\linux-x64\native"
3. Create a nuspec file with name SkiaSharp.Linux.nuspec using the following metadata information and place it inside SkiaSharp.Linux folder. The nuspec file can be customized.

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

4. Make sure that the nuget.exe file is present along with SkiaSharp.Linux folder (in the parent folder of SkiaSharp.Linux folder). If not, download it from [here](https://www.nuget.org/downloads#).
5. Open a command prompt and navigate to SkiaSharp.Linux folder.
6. Execute the following command.

~~~
nuget pack SkiaSharp.Linux\SkiaSharp.Linux.nuspec -outputdirectory "C:\NuGet" 
~~~

The output directory can be customized as per your need.

Now, SkiaSharp.Linux NuGet will be generated in the mentioned output directory and add the generated NuGet as additional reference. You can also find the SkiaSharp.Linux NuGet package created by us from [here](https://www.syncfusion.com/downloads/support/directtrac/general/ze/SkiaSharp.Linux.1.59.3-2103435070#).

## Which one is better Azure App Service or Cloud Service for Word to PDF/Image using DocIO?
When the Word document contains metafile images (*.emf or *.wmf), we recommend using Azure Cloud Service.

We have found metafile images (*.emf, *.wmf) that are not supported in Azure App Service while converting a Word document with metafile images into PDF or Image. And also, this is one of the known limitations in Azure App Service. In this scenario, internally, Essential DocIO preserves RedX images in the same size during the Word to PDF or Image conversions to avoid pagination problems.

## Why images are preserved as RedX images in Word to PDF/Image conversion?
**In .NET Core or .NET targeting applications**, metafile (*.wmf, *.emf) images have some limitations in DocIORenderer. Internally, DocIORenderer used the SkiaSharp graphics library to layout the text and images in PDF/Image conversion. And SkiaSharp library does not support the metafile (".emf", ".wmf") images, so, it does not preserve the images in the mentioned applications.

If the Word document contains metafile (*.wmf" or *.emf") images, internally, DocIO preserves those images as RedX images with the same size of the original images during the Word to PDF or Image conversions to avoid pagination problems.

To preserve the expected images in the PDF/Image conversion, we suggest you convert the metafile image formats to bitmap image format (JPEG or PNG) and then perform Word to PDF/Image conversion.

**Suggestions:**
1. You can convert metafile image format to bitmap image format in the Word document using DocIO, you can refer to KB documentation link: [Convert and replace metafile image in word document to bitmap](https://support.syncfusion.com/kb/article/11331/how-to-convert-and-replace-emf-image-in-word-document-to-png-with-same-size?isInternalRefresh=False). As this approach uses System.Drawing.Common, it is known limitation in Linux or cross platforms.

2. Otherwise, you can use the [WPF](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Syncfusion.DocToPDFConverter.Wpf/) or [Windows Forms](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Syncfusion.DocToPDFConverter.WinForms/) platform NuGet packages for .NET Core 3.0 or later versions targeting applications from v17.3.0.x and use the same [C# tab](https://help.syncfusion.com/document-processing/word/conversions/word-to-pdf/net/word-to-pdf) code examples for it. But in Mac and Linux environment, using the [WPF](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Syncfusion.DocToPDFConverter.Wpf) or [Windows Forms](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Syncfusion.DocToPDFConverter.WinForms/) platform NuGet packages have limitations.

## What are the NuGet packages to be installed to perform Word to PDF conversion in Linux OS?
In Linux OS, you can perform Word to PDF conversion using .NET Core (Targeting .netcoreapp) application. You can refer [Word to PDF conversion NuGet packages](https://help.syncfusion.com/document-processing/word/word-library/net/nuget-packages-required#converting-word-document-to-pdf) to know about the packages required to deploy .NET Core (Targeting .netcoreapp) applications with Word to PDF conversion capabilities.

In addition to the previous NuGet packages, the following NuGet packages need to be installed in your application.
