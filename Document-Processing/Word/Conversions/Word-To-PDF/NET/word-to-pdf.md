# Convert Word  to PDF using Syncfusion Word (DocIO) library 

Syncfusion Word library (DocIO) allows you to convert Word document to PDF within a few lines of code in .NET applications and also it does not require Adobe and Microsoft Word application to be installed in the machine. Using this, you can create an input Word document from scratch or load an existing Word document and then easily convert to PDF.  

The Syncfusion Word to PDF converter offers high versatility and seamless performance across various .NET platforms, including [Windows Forms](https://help.syncfusion.com/document-processing/word/conversions/word-to-pdf/net/convert-word-document-to-pdf-in-window-forms), [WPF](https://help.syncfusion.com/document-processing/word/conversions/word-to-pdf/net/convert-word-document-to-pdf-in-wpf), [ASP.NET](https://help.syncfusion.com/document-processing/word/conversions/word-to-pdf/net/convert-word-document-to-pdf-in-asp-net), [ASP.NET MVC](https://help.syncfusion.com/document-processing/word/conversions/word-to-pdf/net/convert-word-document-to-pdf-in-asp-net-mvc), [ASP.NET Core](https://help.syncfusion.com/document-processing/word/conversions/word-to-pdf/net/convert-word-document-to-pdf-in-asp-net-core), [Blazor](https://help.syncfusion.com/document-processing/word/conversions/word-to-pdf/net/convert-word-document-to-pdf-in-blazor), [Xamarin](https://help.syncfusion.com/document-processing/word/conversions/word-to-pdf/net/convert-word-document-to-pdf-in-xamarin), [WinUI](https://help.syncfusion.com/document-processing/word/conversions/word-to-pdf/net/convert-word-document-to-pdf-in-winui), [.NET MAUI](https://help.syncfusion.com/document-processing/word/conversions/word-to-pdf/net/convert-word-document-to-pdf-in-maui).

T> For troubleshooting issues in the .NET Word Library (DocIO), refer [this](https://support.syncfusion.com/kb/article/16012/troubleshooting-guide-for-syncfusion-word-docio-library-issues?isInternalRefresh=False) article that provides comprehensive guidance on resolving common problems.

N> 1. For .NET Framework, creating an instance of the [ChartToImageConverter](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/document-processing/Syncfusion.OfficeChartToImageConverter.ChartToImageConverter.html) class is mandatory to convert the charts present in the Word to PDF. Otherwise, the charts are not preserved in the converted PDF. Whereas this is not necessary for .NET Core, as ChartToImageConverter is initialized internally in Syncfusion.DocIORenderer.Portable assembly.
N> 2. Total number of pages in the converted PDF may vary based on unsupported elements in the input Word document.
N> 3. "DocIO supports Word to PDF conversion in UWP application using DocIORenderer." For further information, please refer [here](https://support.syncfusion.com/kb/article/8902/how-to-convert-word-document-to-pdf-in-uwp)

## Supported File formats

The .NET Word Library (DocIO) supports below formats to convert into PDF. 

* DOC, DOCX, Word Processing XML (2003 & 2007), DOT, DOTX, DOCM, and DOTM
* RTF

### Recreate Nested Metafile

This setting allows you to regenerate the nested EMF images present in the Word document during PDF conversion. For further information, click [here](https://help.syncfusion.com/document-processing/word/conversions/word-to-pdf/net/word-to-pdf-settings#recreate-nested-metafile).

### Identical image optimization 

This setting **reduces the Main Memory usage** in Word to PDF conversion by reusing the identical images. For further information, click [here](https://help.syncfusion.com/document-processing/word/conversions/word-to-pdf/net/word-to-pdf-settings#identical-image-optimization).

### PDF Conformance Level

This setting allows you to set the PDF conformance level. For further information, click [here](https://help.syncfusion.com/document-processing/word/conversions/word-to-pdf/net/word-to-pdf-settings#pdf-conformance-level).

### Enable Alternate Chunks

In the Word document, another Word documents are embedded in it and referred as AltChunks. This setting allows you to include the alternate chunks while converting Word to PDF conversion. For further information, click [here](https://help.syncfusion.com/document-processing/word/conversions/word-to-pdf/net/word-to-pdf-settings#enable-alternate-chunks).

### Complex Script Text

### Hyphenation in Word-to-PDF conversion

Essential DocIO now allows hyphenating text in a Word document while converting it to PDF format based on the given language dictionaries. For further information, click [here](https://help.syncfusion.com/document-processing/word/conversions/word-to-pdf/net/word-to-pdf-settings#hyphenation-in-word-to-pdf-conversion).

### Track changes in Word-to-PDF conversion

You can **preserve revision marks in a generated PDF document** when converting Word documents with tracked changes or revisions. For further information, click [here](https://help.syncfusion.com/document-processing/word/conversions/word-to-pdf/net/word-to-pdf-settings#track-changes-in-word-to-pdf-conversion).

### Comments in Word-to-PDF conversion

You can **preserve comments balloon in a generated PDF** when converting Word documents with comments. Also you can customize how comments balloon color appears in a generated PDF. For further information, click [here](https://help.syncfusion.com/document-processing/word/conversions/word-to-pdf/net/word-to-pdf-settings#comments-in-word-to-pdf-conversion).

### Preserve Ole Equation as bitmap image

You can preserve Ole Equation as bitmap image in the converted PDF document. For further information, click [here](https://help.syncfusion.com/document-processing/word/conversions/word-to-pdf/net/word-to-pdf-settings#preserve-ole-equation-as-bitmap-image).

### Restrict all permission in a PDF document

You can restrict all the permission in a PDF document using [PdfPermissionsFlags](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/document-processing/Syncfusion.Pdf.Security.PdfPermissionsFlags.html). For further information, click [here](https://help.syncfusion.com/document-processing/word/conversions/word-to-pdf/net/word-to-pdf-settings#restrict-all-permission-in-a-pdf-document).

## Font Substitution

When the necessary fonts used in the Word document has not been installed in the production machine, then Essential DocIO uses the ”Microsoft Sans Serif” as default font for rendering the text. This leads to preservation difference in generated PDF as each font has different glyphs for characters. 

To avoid this, the Essential DocIO library allows you to set an alternate font for the missing font used in the Word document. For further information, click [here](https://help.syncfusion.com/document-processing/word/conversions/word-to-pdf/net/font-substituion-word-to-pdf).

## Fallback fonts

During Word to PDF conversions, if a glyph of the input text is unavailable in the specified font, the text will not be rendered properly. To address this, the Syncfusion Word (DocIO) library allows users to specify fallback fonts. When a glyph is missing, the library will use one of the fallback fonts to render the text correctly in the output PDF document. For further information, click [here](https://help.syncfusion.com/document-processing/word/conversions/word-to-pdf/net/fallback-fonts-word-to-pdf).

## Unsupported elements in Word to PDF conversion

Refer [here](https://help.syncfusion.com/document-processing/word/conversions/word-to-pdf/net/unsupported-elements-word-to-pdf) to know about unsupported elements in Word to PDF conversion.

## Show Warning for Unsupported Elements

When converting a Word document to a PDF, the presence of unsupported elements in the input Word document can lead to preservation issues in the converted PDF. For further information, click [here](https://help.syncfusion.com/document-processing/word/conversions/word-to-pdf/net/unsupported-elements-word-to-pdf#show-warning-for-unsupported-elements).
