## Working with Document Conversions

The Essential DocIO converts documents from one format to another format. Each file format document can be categorized as flow layout document or fixed layout document.

**Flow layout document**

* A flow document is designed to "reflow content" depending on the application.
* Does not contain any information about the position of its content.
* Dynamically renders the content by application at run time.
* Example: DOC, DOCX, HTML, EPUB, RTF, and TEXT file formats.

**Fixed layout document**

* This format of fixed document is like "what you see is what you get".
* Maintains the fixed position for each content.
* Statically preserves the content in specified position.
* Example: Image and PDF.


Essential DocIO can convert various flow document as fixed document by using our layout engine. Following conversions are supported by Essential DocIO.

* Microsoft Word file format Conversions
* Word document to PDF
* Word document to Image
* RTF Conversions
* Text Conversions
* HTML Conversions
* Word document to ODT
* Word document to EPUB
