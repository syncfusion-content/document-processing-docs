# Troubleshooting Mail Merge Issues in .NET Word Library

## Why is mail merge not working correctly in DocIO?

Mail merge issues can arise due to incorrect merge fields, mismatched data sources, or missing fields in the template. Ensure the following:

*  Merge fields (<<FieldName>>) are used instead of plain text.
*  **Data Source Check:** Ensure the required fields exist in the data source.
*  **Field Name Verification:** Ensure that field names in the data source exactly match those in the template (case-sensitive).
*  **Show Field Codes:** Press Alt + F9 in Microsoft Word to reveal field codes and verify they are correct.

## Why does mail merge not recognize manually typed text in Word document?

Mail merge only works with merge fields, not manually typed placeholders. If text is entered instead of a merge field, Word treats it as plain text.

**Solution using Microsoft Word:**
1.	Navigate to Insert â†’ Field or press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F9</kbd>.
2.	Right-click the inserted field and select Edit Field.
3.	Choose MergeField from the list and specify the field name.

**Solution using DocIO:**
Refer to [Syncfusion<sup>&reg;</sup> Documentation](https://help.syncfusion.com/document-processing/word/word-library/net/working-with-find-and-replace#find-and-replace-a-pattern-of-text-with-a-merge-field) for detailed implementation.

## Why is nested group mail merge not functioning correctly?

Nested mail merge requires proper execution using the correct method and structure.
*  Use the appropriate overload of the ExecuteNestedGroup method to handle nested groups effectively. Refer to the Syncfusion documentation for supported overloads.
*  Ensure the data structure follows the correct hierarchy for nested groups to maintain implicit relational data.
