# Working with Document Conversions

The [.NET Word Library](https://www.syncfusion.com/document-processing/word-framework/net) or DocIO provides a support to convert documents from one format to another format. Each file format document can be categorized as flow layout document or fixed layout document. 

**Flow layout document:**

* A flow document is designed to "reflow content" depending on application.
* Doesnâ€™t contain any information about the position of its content.
* Dynamically render the content by application at run time.
* Example: DOC, DOCX, HTML, EPUB, RTF and TEXT file formats.

**Fixed layout document:**

* This format of fixed document is something like "what you see is what you get".
* Maintains the fixed position for each content.
* Statically preserve the content in specified position.
* Example: Image and PDF.


Essential DocIO can convert various flow document as fixed document by using our layout engine. Following conversions are supported by Essential DocIO.
