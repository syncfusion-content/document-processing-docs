>**Note**: According to the Word document specifications, it is not possible to modify the **`Predefined Highlight colors`**. This limitation means that the range of highlight colors provided by default cannot be customized or expanded upon by the user to suit individual preferences. Consequently, users must work within the confines of the existing color palette, as no functionality currently exists to modify or personalize these predefined highlighting options.
