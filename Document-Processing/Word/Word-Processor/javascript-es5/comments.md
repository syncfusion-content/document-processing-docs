# Comments in JavaScript (ES5) Document editor control

Document Editor allows you to add comments to documents. You can add, navigate and remove comments in code and from the UI.

## Add a new comment

Comments can be inserted to the selected text.

```ts
//Add new commnt in the document.
documentEditor.editor.insertComment('Test comment');
```

## Add a New Comment with Date, Author, and Status

Comments can be inserted into the selected text with a specified date, author, and status [`insertComment`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/javascript/documentation/api/document-editor/editor#insertcomment).

{% highlight js %}
// In this example, a comment with the text "Hello world"
// is added by the author Nancy Davolio on July 23, 2024, at 2:30 PM. 
// The isResolved status is set to false.

// Create a specific date: July 23, 2024, at 2:30:00 PM.
// Note: July is represented by 6 (0-based index).
var specificDate = new Date(2024, 6, 23, 14, 30, 0);

// Define the properties of the comment including author, date, and resolution status.
var commentProperties = { 
    author: 'Nancy Davolio',          // The author of the comment.
    dateTime: specificDate,           // The date and time when the comment is created.
    isResolved: false                 // The status of the comment; false indicates it is unresolved.
};

// Insert the comment with the specified properties into the document editor.
documentEditor.editor.insertComment('Hello world', commentProperties);
{% endhighlight %}

## Add a Reply Comment with Date, Author, and Status

Reply comments can be inserted into the parent comment with a specified date, author using [`insertReplyComment`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/javascript/documentation/api/document-editor/editor#insertreplycomment/).

{% highlight js %}
// In this example, a comment with the text "Hello world"
// is added by the author Nancy Davolio on July 23, 2024, at 2:30 PM. 
// The isResolved status is set to false.

// Create a specific date: July 23, 2024, at 2:30:00 PM.
// Note: July is represented by 6 (0-based index).
var specificDate = new Date(2024, 6, 23, 14, 30, 0);

// Define the properties of the comment including author, date, and resolution status.
var commentProperties = { 
    author: 'Nancy Davolio',          // The author of the comment.
    dateTime: specificDate,           // The date and time when the comment is created.
    isResolved: false                 // The status of the comment; false indicates it is unresolved.
};

// Insert the comment with the specified properties into the document editor.
var comment = documentEditor.editor.insertComment('Hello world', commentProperties);
// Insert a reply comment with specified properties into the Document Editor
documentEditor.editor.insertReplyComment(comment.id, 'Hello world', commentProperties);
{% endhighlight %}

## Get Comments

Document Editor allows to get the comments along with its reply and comment properties using [`getComments`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/javascript/documentation/api/document-editor#getComments/).

{% highlight js %}
//Get Comments in the document along with the properties author, date, status.
var commentInfo = container.documentEditor.getComments();
{% endhighlight %}


## Comment navigation

Next and previous comments can be navigated using the below code snippet.

```ts
//Navigate to next comment
documentEditor.selection.navigateNextComment();

//Navigate to previous comment
documentEditor.selection.navigatePreviousComment();
```


## Delete comment

Current comment can be be deleted using [`deleteComment`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/javascript/documentation/api/document-editor/editor#deletecomment/).


{% highlight js %}
//Delete the current selected comment.
container.documentEditor.editor.deleteComment();

//Get Comments in the document along with the properties author, date, status.
var commentinfo = container.documentEditor.getComments();

//Delete the particular parent comments and all of its reply comments
container.documentEditor.editor.deleteComment(commentinfo[0].id);

//Delete the particular reply comment.
container.documentEditor.editor.deleteComment(commentinfo[0].replies[0].id);
{% endhighlight %}

## Delete all comment

All the comments in the document can be deleted using the below code snippet.

```ts
//Delete all the comments present in the current document.
documentEditor.editor.deleteAllComments();
```

## Protect the document in comments only mode

Document Editor provides support for protecting the document with `CommentsOnly` protection. In this protection, user allowed to add or edit comments alone in the document.

Document editor provides an option to protect and unprotect document using [`enforceProtection`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/javascript/documentation/api/document-editor/editor#enforceprotection/) and [`stopProtection`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/javascript/documentation/api/document-editor/editor#stopprotection/) API.

The following example code illustrates how to enforce and stop protection in Document editor container.

```ts
let container: DocumentEditorContainer = new DocumentEditorContainer({
  enableToolbar: true,
  height: '590px',
});
DocumentEditorContainer.Inject(Toolbar);
container.serviceUrl =
  'http://localhost:5000/api/documenteditor/';
container.appendTo('#container');

//enforce protection
container.documentEditor.editor.enforceProtection('123', 'CommentsOnly');

//stop the document protection
container.documentEditor.editor.stopProtection('123');
```

Comment only protection can be enabled in UI by using [Restrict Editing pane](./document-management#restrict-editing-pane)

![Enable comment only protection](images/commentsonly.png)

>Note: In enforce Protection method, first parameter denotes password and second parameter denotes protection type. Possible values of protection type are `NoProtection |ReadOnly |FormFieldsOnly |CommentsOnly`. In stop protection method, parameter denotes the password.

## Mention Support in comments

Mention support displays a list of items that users can select or tag from the suggested list. To use this feature, type the @ character in the comment box and select or tag the user from the suggestion list.

The following example illustrates how to enable mention support in Document Editor

```ts
let mentionData: any = [
    { "Name": "Mary Kate", "EmailId": "marry@company.com" },
    { "Name": "Andrew James", "EmailId": "james@company.com" },
    { "Name": "Andrew Fuller", "EmailId": "andrew@company.com"}
];
let container: DocumentEditorContainer = new DocumentEditorContainer({ enableToolbar: true,height: '590px',
// Enable mention support in document editor
  documentEditorSettings: {
    mentionSettings: { dataSource: mentionData, fields: { text: 'Name' }},
  }
});
DocumentEditorContainer.Inject(Toolbar);
container.serviceUrl = 'https://document.syncfusion.com/web-services/docx-editor/api/documenteditor/';
container.appendTo('#container');
```

For production deployment, please host your own web service with your required server configurations. You can refer and reuse the [GitHub Web Service example](https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/EJ2-DocumentEditor-WebServices) or [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/syncfusion/word-processor-server) for hosting your own web service and use for the serviceUrl property.

## Events

DocumentEditor provides [beforeCommentAction](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/javascript/documentation/api/document-editor-container#beforecommentaction/) event, which is triggered on comment actions like Post, edit, reply, resolve and reopen. This event provides an opportunity to perform custom logic on comment actions like Post, edit, reply, resolve and reopen. The event handler receives the [CommentActionEventArgs](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/javascript/documentation/api/document-editor/commentActionEventArgs/) object as an argument, which allows access to information about the comment.

To demonstrate a specific use case, let’s consider an example where we want to restrict the delete functionality based on the author’s name. The following code snippet illustrates how to allow only the author of a comment to delete:

```js

var mentionData = [
    { "Name": "Mary Kate", "EmailId": "marry@company.com" },
    { "Name": "Andrew James", "EmailId": "james@company.com" },
    { "Name": "Andrew Fuller", "EmailId": "andrew@company.com"}
    ];
    // Initialize DocumentEditorContainer component.
    var documenteditorContainer = new ej.documenteditor.DocumentEditorContainer({ enableToolbar: true, height: '590px', beforeCommentAction:beforecomment,documentEditorSettings: {
    mentionSettings: { dataSource: mentionData, fields: { text: 'Name' }},
  } });
    ej.documenteditor.DocumentEditorContainer.Inject(ej.documenteditor.Toolbar);
    documenteditorContainer.serviceUrl = 'http://localhost:6028/api/documenteditor/';
    //DocumentEditorContainer control rendering starts
    documenteditorContainer.appendTo('#DocumentEditor');
    documenteditorContainer.currentUser = "Guest User";


    // Event get triggerd on comment actions like Post, edit, reply, resolve and reopen
    function beforecomment(args){
      // Check the type and author of the comment and current user are different
      if(args.type === "Delete" && documenteditorContainer.currentUser !== args.author){
        // Cancel the comment action
        args.cancel = true;
      }
    }
```
